# Color chooser

This is just a small java program made to show an
inefficient method of choosing colors. Contributions are
welcome, unless they're stuff like changing the spelling
of 'colour' in local variables to the 'proper' spelling.

## Contributing

Don't commit any project configuration files (Eclipse,
IDEA, NetBeans, etc.). Other than that, do whatever you
want.

## Using the program

a) Don't

b) If you must, get it from the [releases](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/colorchooser/releases)
   page.
